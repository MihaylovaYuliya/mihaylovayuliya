I am a Junior QA engineer with theoretical and practical knowledge of manual testing.  Since I had finished a testing course, I realized how important it is to be attentive to details and team player. I like new challenges that make me want to learn more and improve my skills every day. I seek to join a company that will give me the chance to apply my knowledge and develop myself as a QA engineer
